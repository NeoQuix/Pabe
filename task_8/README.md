# Broken Header

Oh no! Our binary `broken` is causing segmentation faults. What is happening here? There could be something wrong with the header...

Your task is to write a Python script that patches and executes the binary `broken`. 

Your solution could, for example, look like:

```shell
$ ./solution
FLAG{some letters and digits here}
```

Hint: You should check the header of a working binary (e.g. `/bin/ls`) and compare it to the broken binary.
