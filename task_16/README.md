# Say my name!

We have reused code from an old authentication system.
It seems like security was not that important in those daysâ€¦


Find a vulnerability in the binary `say_my_name` and edit the provided `solution` template so that it:

1. Explains in a comment where the bug is located and how it can be fixed
2. Exploits the binary and prints (only) the flag


Your solution should execute like this:

```
$ ./solution
FLAG{some letters and digits}
```
