# Two Bugs

The binary `two_bugs` containsâ€¦ well, two bugs.
Can you exploit both to get the flag printed?

Edit the provided `solution` template and explain your approach with meaningful comments!

Hints:

- Are you able to leak everything you need to know?
- Which kind of **code reuse attack** do you know?

Your solution should execute like this:

```
./solution
FLAG{some letters here}
```
