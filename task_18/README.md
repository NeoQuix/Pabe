# No Xystem for you

We made indeed a huge mistake by disabling the compiler's default option.
But we fixed that!
Now your previous exploit should not work anymore.

I am getting out on our campus and heading back to our building C - the library - to read about methods to increase security even more.
In the meantime, try to exploit our new binary `no_xystem` and print the flag.

Once more, edit the provided `solution` template!

Your solution should look like:

```
$ ./solution
FLAG{some letters and digits}
```
