# A little printer developed during Xmas

Our developer team just built this little printer during Xmas.
We hope you enjoy our printer while the baubles are still dangling under your Xmas tree.

Try to exploit `myLittlePrinter` and print the flag!

Once again, edit the provided `solution` template and explain your approach with meaningful comments!

Hints:

- What do you know about dangling pointers?
- Do you remember format string bugs?

Your solution should execute like this:

```
./solution
FLAG{some letters here}
```
